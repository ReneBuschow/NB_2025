Dear reader,

within our here installed github project directory. We publish the code generated to solve our specific questions. You can download and modify the published code as desired given the citation of the person who generated it: René Buschow (buschow@molgen.mpg.de, 0049 30 8413 1663, Imaging Core Facility),  and Nadine Brombacher (0049 030 8413 1563, High-Resolution Neurogenetics) both Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, 14195 Berlin - Germany. 

DEMO-Data: Raw Image data for the documentated pipelin as well as pixelwise expression/morphometrics/profiles can be found here : https://nc.molgen.mpg.de/cloud/index.php/s/QXPp3b6sJjBkwG6 . NOTE: The here shared data is a tif export from its original .czi format without any compression or modification. 

We are ready and happy to share way more raw data, but please be aware/prepared that many of our experiments are imaging based and therefore often exceeed 10,20... gb. We have the the infrastructure to share it over own online repositories but our data policy is encouraging us to better archive data than cloud share it on a long term. But feel free to contact René or Adriano for more.
